# DIVE DIVE DIVE (dive3) - a dive log

## Technologies

## Approach

### User stories
``` text
As a [diver with many dives], I want to be able to
  log dives from a simple interface
so that
  logging dives isn't such a chore.

As a [lazy diver], I want to be able to
  log only the essential details if I don't have the rest
so that
  I can log dives even if I don't have detailed information.

As a [diver who goes on many trips], I want to be able to
  log dives as belonging to a trip
so that
  I can revisit a trip and reminisce.
