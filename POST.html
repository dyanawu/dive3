<h1>Project Post Mortem</h1>

<h2>Approach and Process</h2>

<ol>
<li>What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I might have spent a little more time thinking about the design and exploring something like CSS mixins to avoid what turned out to be a lot of repeated styling classes, even though I had React component classes.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I felt I scoped it decently - I managed to see the size of the data I would be dealing with early enough that I was able to cut parts and still have a functional vertical slice. Deciding to go MVC from the start was also a good idea.</em></p>

<h2>Code and Code Design</h2>

<ol>
<li>What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I ended up having controllers use multiple models and couldn't tell if that made sense, so I would have thought about my models a bit more perhaps.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I managed to have a relation that should be easy to extend and turned out to be somewhat modular.</em></p>

<p>For each, please include code examples.
  1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
  2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams

<h2>WDI Unit 2 Post Mortem</h2>

<ol>
<li>What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I got better at committing more frequently and at context-jumping less frequently.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I would still like to improve on having each commit be a partial working state and will practise that - probably using more placeholders for information, etc.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I had a lot of fun this unit learning more server-side stuff, but look forward to having frontend frameworks to help with more dynamic/stateful frontends.</em></p>
